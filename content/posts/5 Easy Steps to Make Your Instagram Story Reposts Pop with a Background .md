Whether it's a funny quote, an inspiring message, or a photo of a cute animal, reposts are a great way to keep your followers engaged and entertained. But did you know that you can make your reposts even more eye-catching and engaging by adding a background? Read on to find out how!

## Definition of Instagram Story Reposts

Instagram Story Reposts are posts that are shared from other accounts and appear in your story. They are great for sharing content from other accounts without having to post it directly to your own feed.

## Benefits of Adding Backgrounds to Reposts

Adding a background to your reposts can help make them stand out from the rest of your story. It can also help draw attention to the content you are sharing, making it more likely that your followers will engage with it. Additionally, adding a background can help make your reposts look more professional and polished.

## Step 1: Choose Your Background

The first step in making your Instagram Story Reposts stand out is to choose a background. There are a few different options you can choose from, such as selecting a color, finding a graphic, or utilizing a template.

### Selecting a Color

The simplest way to add a background to your reposts is to select a solid color. You can choose any color you like, but it is best to select one that will complement the content you are sharing.

### Finding a Graphic

If you want something a bit more interesting than a solid color, you can find a graphic to use as your background. There are many websites that offer free and paid graphics that you can use.

### Utilizing a Template

Another option is to utilize a template. Templates are great because they come with pre-made designs that are easy to customize. You can find templates on websites such as Canva or Adobe Spark.

## Step 2: Add Your Content

Once you have chosen your background, it is time to add your content.

### Choosing the Right Content

When selecting content for your reposts, it is important to make sure it is relevant to your followers. Try to choose content that will be interesting and engaging to your audience.

### Editing the Content

Once you have chosen the content you want to share, you can edit it to make it fit with your background. This can include adding text, changing the size or shape of the content, or adding filters or effects.

## Step 3: Save and Share

Once you have added your content and edited it to fit with your background, it is time to save and share your reposts.

### Saving the Story

The first step is to save your story. To do this, simply tap the Save button in the top right corner of your story. This will save your story as a video file so you can easily share it with your followers.

### Sharing the Story

Once your story is saved, you can share it with your followers. To do this, simply tap the Share button in the top right corner of your story. You can then select where you want to share it and your followers will be able to view it.
