## I. Introduction

We've all been there. You're scrolling through your Instagram feed and you come across someone who you've been crushing on. You click on their profile to check out their latest posts, only to find out that you can't view their profile. You may be wondering if they blocked you, but how can you find out? Read on to learn how to determine if that special someone has blocked you on Instagram. 

## II. Reasons Why Someone Might Block You

There are a few reasons why someone might decide to block you on Instagram. It could be because they don't want you to be able to see their posts, or it could be because they are trying to avoid any type of contact with you. Whatever the reason, it's important to know how to find out if you've been blocked. 

## III. How to Find Out if You've Been Blocked

The easiest way to find out if you've been blocked on Instagram is to search for the person's profile. If you can't find their profile, or if it says that the profile is unavailable, then it's likely that you've been blocked. You can also try searching for their username in the search bar. If you can't find their username, then they may have blocked you. 

Another way to find out if you've been blocked is to look at the list of people that you follow. If the person you're interested in is no longer on the list, then they may have blocked you. 

Finally, you can also ask a mutual friend if they can still view the person's profile. If they can, then it's likely that you've been blocked. 

## Conclusion

If you think that someone has blocked you on Instagram, it's important to know how to find out for sure. By searching for their profile, looking at the list of people that you follow, or asking a mutual friend, you can determine if you've been blocked.
