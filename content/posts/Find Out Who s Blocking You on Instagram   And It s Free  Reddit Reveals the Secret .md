## Introduction to Instagram and Blocking

Instagram is a popular social media platform that allows users to share photos, videos, and stories. It has become one of the most popular platforms for sharing content and connecting with friends and family. 

Blocking is a feature on Instagram that allows users to block other users from seeing their posts, stories, or profile. When someone blocks you on Instagram, they won't be able to see your posts, stories, or profile.

## How to Find Out Who's Blocking You on Instagram

Finding out who's blocking you on Instagram can be difficult, but Reddit has recently revealed a way to do it for free. Here's how to do it:

2. Follow the instructions in the post.

The instructions in the post will tell you how to use a free online tool to find out who's blocking you on Instagram. The tool works by scanning your account and looking for any blocked users.

## Conclusion

Finding out who's blocking you on Instagram can be beneficial. Knowing who is blocking you can help you understand why they are blocking you and how to avoid similar situations in the future. However, there are some limitations to this method. The tool only works on public accounts, so if the person blocking you has a private account, you won't be able to see who they are. Additionally, the tool may not be able to detect all blocked users, as some may have blocked you using a different method.
