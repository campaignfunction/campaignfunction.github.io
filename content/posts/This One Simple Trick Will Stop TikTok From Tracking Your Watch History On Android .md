# This One Simple Trick Will Stop TikTok From Tracking Your Watch History On Android! 

We know that TikTok is an incredibly popular app that allows users to share short videos. But did you know that it also tracks your watch history? That's right, TikTok keeps a record of every video you watch and stores it in your account. But don't worry, we have a simple trick that will help you stop TikTok from tracking your watch history on Android devices! 

## How Does TikTok Track Your Watch History?

TikTok uses a combination of algorithms and data collection to track your watch history. Every time you watch a video, TikTok collects data about the video and stores it in your account. This data includes the title of the video, the length of the video, and the time you spent watching it. This information is then used to show you more relevant videos and to suggest new ones.

## How To Stop TikTok From Tracking Your Watch History

Fortunately, there is a simple trick that will help you stop TikTok from tracking your watch history. All you need to do is go to your device's settings and disable the "Allow TikTok to Track Your Watch History" option. Once this option is disabled, TikTok will no longer be able to track your watch history and will no longer be able to suggest new videos to you.

## Benefits of Stopping TikTok From Tracking Your Watch History

By disabling the "Allow TikTok to Track Your Watch History" option, you can be sure that your watch history is private and that TikTok will not be able to suggest videos to you that you may not be interested in. This will help you take control of your watch history and ensure that you only watch videos that you actually want to watch. 

So if you're looking for a way to stop TikTok from tracking your watch history on Android devices, then this simple trick is the perfect solution!
